**Firefox Release  45.0 March 8, 2016:**

Introduce a new preference (network.dns.blockDotOnion) to allow blocking .onion at the DNS level.

The new "feature" is _enabled_ by default to block .onion addresses.

**Browser Error:**

"Server not found" "Firefox canâ€™t find the server at abcxyz.onion" and "problems loading page"

**The Fix:**

`about:config`

Search: blockDotOnion

**Change from: true**

`network.dns.blockDotOnion user set   bolean  true`

**[Change to: false](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B79r4wTVj-CZSkZieEVCWUtKRVE)**

`network.dns.blockDotOnion user set  boolean false`
