> **[TorIptables2](https://github.com/ruped24/toriptables2) routes all traffic on a standalone machine through [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/). Once this is set up, every network application will make its TCP connections through Tor; no application will be able to reveal your [IP address](https://github.com/ruped24/toriptables2#to-test) by connecting directly.**
